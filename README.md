## üßÆ Calculation Logic

- **EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)**  
EMI = [P √ó R √ó (1 + R)^N] / [(1 + R)^N ‚Äì 1]
Where:  
`P` = Loan Amount, `R` = Monthly Interest Rate, `N` = Number of Months

- **Balloon Loan Repayment**  
Flexible schedule with smaller early payments and one large final payment. Interest recalculates monthly.
